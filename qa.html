    Question-1: What are the different ways to select an element in the DOM?

    Answer: There are multiple ways to select an element in the DOM.
    getElementById matches id and selects an unique element, getElementsByClassName matches class name 
    and returns an array-like object containing all the elements with said class, getElementsByTagName 
    matches tags and returns an array-like object containing all the elements of same tag, 
    querySelector matches CSS selectors and returns ONLY the first element that matches the selector, 
    and querySelectorAll does the same thing as querySelector but returns all matched elements.

    Question-2: What is the difference between innerHTML, innerText, and textContent ?

    Answer: innerHTML returns a snippet of the entire HTML within the element, so not only it includes content
    but also stuff like comments which generally do not show up on websites. It includes tags as well.
    Meanwhile, innerText returns ONLY the text content within the elements. While textContent is same as innerText but in addition to visible texts
    it will also include hidden ones as well. For example: a text within a hidden div will be shown
    neither in the website nor in the console when using innerText but will be shown in the console when using textContent.

    Question-3: What is event delegation in the DOM?

    Answer: Instead of repeating the eventListener action for each element we can use it on the parent element to 
    achieve the same result, this is called event delegation. It saves computation power and reduces memory usage.

    Question-4: What is event bubbling in the DOM?

    Answer: To detect an event the browser starts from the root(document) and goes down to the child element, upon
    detecting the child element that triggered the event, it starts coming back to root(document) while checking for additional
    event triggers, this is called event bubbling.

    Question-5: How do you create, add, and remove elements using JavaScript?

    Answer: To create an element we use .createElement. Newly created element can be modified using various command such as
    .innerHTML and so on. To add a new element we can use either .appendchild or .append. Lastly, to remove
    an element we use .removeChild.
